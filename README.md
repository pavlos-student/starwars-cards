# FlextockTask

## Overview

A web application which would take a string in a form input and search for people using this string input in this public API https://swapi.dev. All retrieved results will be rendered as cards and each card will have the characterâ€™s details (Name, URL, height, homeworld). Once rendered the user is able to drag and drop the cards to reorder them on screen.

## Architectural logical flow

### Angular Component and Service logical flow

Interaction between the App's Components and Service

Both SearchBarComponent and CardListComponent are children of the AppComponent. First the user inputs a text in the search bar (in the SearchBarComponent), an event emitter in that component will emit/transfer the search keyword entered by the user to the parent component (AppComponent). The latter will call the SwapiService sending the search term in order to get the meta data from a third party API server - Swapi.dev/api. The SwapiService does an HTTP GET request to get that data and sends it back to the AppComponent. Finally the AppComponent sends the meta-data to the CardListComponent to be rendered to the user.
